Here’s a `README.md` for your **Dummy Systemd Service** project in the same style as your Netdata example:

---

# 🛠 Dummy Systemd Service

This project demonstrates how to **create a custom systemd service** on Linux that executes a bash script and logs output, helping you learn service automation and permissions management.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ⚡ **Custom systemd service** that runs a bash script
* 🔁 **Automatic restart** on failure
* 📄 **Logs output** to a file
* 🧭 **Hands-on DevOps learning project** inspired by a roadmap
* 📝 **Configurable** via service file (`User`, `Group`, `WorkingDirectory`, etc.)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ismail-en-niou/Dummy-Systemd-Service.git
cd Dummy-Systemd-Service
```

### 2️⃣ Copy the Service File

```bash
sudo cp test.service /etc/systemd/system/test.service
```

### 3️⃣ Reload systemd

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### 4️⃣ Enable and Start the Service

## ⚙️ Roadmap

This project is inspired by the [Simple Monitoring Dashboard Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/projects/dummy-systemd-service) and is part of my journey in **DevOps, Linux system administration, and service automation**.

Future improvements could include:

* Using **environment files** for dynamic configuration
* Implementing **log rotation** to prevent disk bloat
* Adding **health checks** and alert notifications
* Containerizing the service with Docker for easier deployment
